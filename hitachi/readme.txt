Hitachi Talking Alarm Clock Radio

This is a Steve'sClock implementation of a mid-80's Hitachi talking alarm clock radio, model unknown.
All original sample aliasing and output saturation is included.
These wave files are edited so as to mimmick the proper speaking cadence of the original samples, and is not, in fact, a case of sloppy editing.

Some extra files are included for posterity: ding1-ding5.wav, which are played at various points when setting the clock.
ding1.wav indicates top of hour, ding2.wav is used for AM hour markers, ding3.wav for PM hour markers, ding4.wav indicates minutes between 01-29 and 31-59 (of course, excluding 00 and 30), and ding5.wav indicates bottom of hour.

message1-message3.wav are alternative alarm messages provided by the clock.
As with many talking clocks, the time and message (or ding) are repeted for one minute, which is not yet properly implemented with Steve'sClock.

Enjoy this rare 80's relic that no one seems to have ever heard of.
